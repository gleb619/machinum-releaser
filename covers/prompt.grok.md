Create with height 800 and width 600 a pixel book cover for a fantasy novel titled The Awakened Artisan. The scene is
set in a mystical blacksmith’s workshop illuminated by the warm, fiery glow of a forge at twilight, casting dramatic
shadows. In the foreground, a young blacksmith stands holding a glowing, intricately designed hammer, with faint
ethereal wisps of light—representing his Soulforge ability—emanating from it. Behind him, an ancient, leather-bound
manual titled The Art of Living Metal rests on a worn wooden table, its pages faintly glowing with cryptic runes and
diagrams that hint at forbidden knowledge. The manual’s presence feels both alluring and ominous. In the background, a
partially forged sword lies in the forge, its blade shimmering with molten metal and subtle magical energy. The workshop
is filled with tools, anvils, and shelves of metal ingots, creating a rich, tactile atmosphere. Above the blacksmith, a
faint vision of a shadowy, tragic figure—the master smith—appears in the smoke, adding mystery. The color palette blends
deep blues and purples of twilight with fiery oranges and reds from the forge, contrasted by the metallic sheen of
steel. The title The Awakened Artisan is written in elegant, slightly weathered fantasy-style typography at the top,
with the author’s name ( placeholder: ‘By Generic’) in smaller, classic font at the bottom. The overall tone is intense,
mystical, and slightly foreboding, capturing themes of ambition, forbidden knowledge, and transformation.
